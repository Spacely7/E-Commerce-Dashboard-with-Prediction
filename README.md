- Real-time filtering by region, product category, and date range
- Dynamic KPI metrics showing sales performance and profitability 
- Time-series analysis of sales and profit trends
- Categorical breakdowns of top-performing products
- Regional performance heat maps and comparisons

### üîÆ Machine Learning Integration
- Linear regression model to predict profit based on multiple parameters
- Interactive prediction interface for what-if scenario planning
- Model performance metrics (R¬≤ and RMSE) for transparency
- Feature importance visualization for business understanding

### üí° Business Intelligence
- Automated detection of underperforming categories
- Customer segment analysis for targeted marketing
- Loss-prone region identification for logistics optimization
- Actionable recommendations based on data patterns

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation
- Data preprocessing with pandas for robust analysis
- Data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn
- Machine learning pipeline with scikit-learn
- Interactive web application with Streamlit
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Technologies Used
